**An Introduction to Recursion in Python with Examples**  

Recursion is a powerful concept in computer science, used when a function calls itself. In Python, recursion allows for elegant solutions to problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems. Below is an overview of recursion in Python, including how it works and common use cases.

## What is Recursion? ü§î

Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve a problem. This technique is often used in algorithms that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems. Here's an example:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
